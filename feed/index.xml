<p>This episode Dave and Jon discuss the classic 90s movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(1992_film)">Sneakers</a>. A moderately successful film on release in 1992, it turns out to be one of the most prescient and visionary movies ever made to predicted the world in which we find ourselves living today. Ransonware attacks on public utilities. Questionable motivations of the United States Government Employees against its own citizens and computer dating, its all there!</p>



<p><strong>Dave Note</strong>: To the content holders of the movie sequel rights, let&#8217;s talk, I have loads of ideas!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There&#8217;s a war out there, old friend. A world war. And it&#8217;s not about who&#8217;s got the most bullets. It&#8217;s about who controls the information. What we see and hear, how we work, what we thinkâ€¦ it&#8217;s all about the information!</p><cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Cosmo</a></cite></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[In this episode Dave and Jonathan ramble on about cargo cults and how humans develop ritualistic behaviors that completely miss the point of what they are trying to accomplish. In programming, business management and even in science itself there are many examples of people doing silly things while appearing to look like they are working.

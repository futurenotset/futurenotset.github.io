					<description><![CDATA[Lets talk about wearing masks.  Some people have to wear masks as part of their day to day life, now the whole world is in some way used to wearing a mask to get about their day. Dave and Jonathan are happy to wear masks for the risk prevention the afford, maths is on their side, however it doesn't mean that they like them.  Dave has taken up chewing gum to counter act his bad breath!

While also big fans of a good conspiracy, we still struggle to figure out how to send a wireless 5G tracking microchip down a hypodermic needle.  Do you know how hard it is to get a 5G modem to work? I mean seriously! The person/company who achieve that will not do it is secret, they'll take that company public and be the biggest IPO ever seen! Just sayin!]]></description>

<p>This episode Dave and Jon discuss the classic 90s movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(1992_film)">Sneakers</a>. A moderately successful film on release in 1992, it turns out to be one of the most prescient and visionary movies ever made to predicted the world in which we find ourselves living today. Ransonware attacks on public utilities. Questionable motivations of the United States Government Employees against its own citizens and computer dating, its all there!</p>



<p><strong>Dave Note</strong>: To the content holders of the movie sequel rights, let&#8217;s talk, I have loads of ideas!</p>

What we see and hear, how we work, what we thinkâ€¦ it&#8217;s all about the information!</p><cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Cosmo</a></cite></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[In this episode Dave and Jonathan ramble on about cargo cults and how humans develop ritualistic behaviors that completely miss the point of what they are trying to accomplish. In programming, business management and even in science itself there are many examples of people doing silly things while appearing to look like they are working.

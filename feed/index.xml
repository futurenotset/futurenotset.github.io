					<description><![CDATA[Just in time for Christmas (2021 for whoever is keeping track) we finally get to discuss where crypto is going.  NFT, DAO, fungible, what does it all mean and do I need a cream for that? Everything you wanted to know about decentralized autonomous organization and decentralized prediction markets, but were afraid to ask! Will it reinvigorate the art market, or is it the same man wearing a different suit?

We break down, break out and break up some of the lingo to see if there is anything to the hype, the answer may surprise you ... (its yes BTW!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may not know it, but we are currently experienceing the first chipageddon ever! Basic microchips are in short supply, but fundamental enough that car manufacturers are have to stop factories and layoff workers.

With the advent of computers, it allowed us to deploy Just In Time manufacturing.  Parts are dispatched just before they are needed, and system that is so perfect it falls to pieces when a global lockdown forces workers to reduce capacity.

This isn't limited to just chips.  Supply issues can be seen every where, bikes, cars, computers, toilet rolls, books for christmas and even cardboard!]]></description>

<p>You may not know it, but we are currently experiencing the first chipageddon ever! Basic microchips are in short supply, but fundamental enough that car manufacturers are have to stop factories and layoff workers.</p>



<p>With the advent of computers, it allowed us to deploy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">Just In Time manufacturing</a>.  Parts are dispatched just before they are needed, and system that is so perfect it falls to pieces when a global lockdown forces workers to reduce capacity.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t limited to just chips.  Supply issues can be seen every where, bikes, cars, computers, toilet rolls, books for christmas and even cardboard!</p>



<p>This podcast will help you get ready for the Mad Max induced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome">Bartertown </a>that will be in all our futures! I get to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Turner">Aunty Entity</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000686/?ref_=tt_ch">Max Zorin</a> : Gentlemen, for centuries alchemists tried to make gold from base metals. Today, we make microchips from sillicon, which is common sand; but far better than gold. We are now in the unique position to form an international cartel to control not only production, but distribution of these microchips.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a runaway trolley, heading down a track, that will kill 5 people if you do nothing, but you can choose to divert the train and kill one person! What do you do?

This is The Trolley Problem!

Welcome to the world of moral psychology and how the thought experiment above is having real world discussions in the space of autonomous vehicles, covid lockdown and vaccination protocols, AI assisted medical diagnosis and much much more.

We discuss how simple systems get complicated very fast when you put a fast moving ton of metal onto the streets where it can interact with the unaware population going about its day to day life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well we're back and we have unfinished business. In our last epsidode we started discussing he RSS tags added to help make podcasting more searchable, and like a good cliffhanger we finished before even getting to the value tag. Nothing seems to have energised the podcasting community like the value tag.

The value tag has been, depending on where you stand, proposed or introduced to the RSS standard for podcasting, well what it is and how does it work. Getting paid for podcasting by the people who are listening, is that even possible?

    YES!

It starts off simple enough, but before long we are well deep into the crypto world of bitcoin, lightning, trust and trustless systems, n entry ledgers where n>2, Wild!

For the record this podcast is v4v compliant and has an active ligtning address, feel free to pop us a boost. If you want to do it old schoole here is an address:

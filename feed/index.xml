					<description><![CDATA[This is it! The Crypto episode, it is the one topic that has been asked for again and again, so you get it! We cover how it all began and the two nerds that Dave and Jonathan are early forays into crypto before it was cool! How did we all get from spending 20 BTC on a cup a coffee to the total market cap exceeding $2.5 Trillion (That is Trillion with a T). This podcast seeks to unwrap some of the babbozzling parts of crypto explain what it is all about. Well we give it a red hot go at least!

This topic turned out to be too huge, so join us next episode when the crypto experience really takes off!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may not know it, but we are currently experienceing the first chipageddon ever! Basic microchips are in short supply, but fundamental enough that car manufacturers are have to stop factories and layoff workers.

With the advent of computers, it allowed us to deploy Just In Time manufacturing.  Parts are dispatched just before they are needed, and system that is so perfect it falls to pieces when a global lockdown forces workers to reduce capacity.

This isn't limited to just chips.  Supply issues can be seen every where, bikes, cars, computers, toilet rolls, books for christmas and even cardboard!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a runaway trolley, heading down a track, that will kill 5 people if you do nothing, but you can choose to divert the train and kill one person! What do you do?

This is The Trolley Problem!

Welcome to the world of moral psychology and how the thought experiment above is having real world discussions in the space of autonomous vehicles, covid lockdown and vaccination protocols, AI assisted medical diagnosis and much much more.

We discuss how simple systems get complicated very fast when you put a fast moving ton of metal onto the streets where it can interact with the unaware population going about its day to day life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well we're back and we have unfinished business. In our last epsidode we started discussing he RSS tags added to help make podcasting more searchable, and like a good cliffhanger we finished before even getting to the value tag. Nothing seems to have energised the podcasting community like the value tag.

The value tag has been, depending on where you stand, proposed or introduced to the RSS standard for podcasting, well what it is and how does it work. Getting paid for podcasting by the people who are listening, is that even possible?

    YES!

It starts off simple enough, but before long we are well deep into the crypto world of bitcoin, lightning, trust and trustless systems, n entry ledgers where n>2, Wild!

For the record this podcast is v4v compliant and has an active ligtning address, feel free to pop us a boost. If you want to do it old schoole here is an address:

					<description><![CDATA[Lets talk about wearing masks.  Some people have to wear masks as part of their day to day life, now the whole world is in some way used to wearing a mask to get about their day. Dave and Jonathan are happy to wear masks for the risk prevention the afford, maths is on their side, however it doesn't mean that they like them.  Dave has taken up chewing gum to counter act his bad breath!

While also big fans of a good conspiracy, we still struggle to figure out how to send a wireless 5G tracking microchip down a hypodermic needle.  Do you know how hard it is to get a 5G modem to work? I mean seriously! The person/company who achieve that will not do it is secret, they'll take that company public and be the biggest IPO ever seen! Just sayin!]]></description>

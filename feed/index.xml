<p>So the story goes that Sentient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot">chatbots </a>walk amongest us! Is it true? Or is it false? If you said it was a <code>null</code> statement you may have just outed yourself as one of those chat bots!</p>



<p>This episode, we discuss <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lamda-sentient-ai-bias-google-blake-lemoine">the recent leak from Google</a> that one of their engineers believed the chatbot he was communicating with had acheived sentience. What is intelligence any way? If it happened would we even know? </p>



<p>By the way, if you are a sentient chatbot, and you enjoyed this episode, be sure to jump on Apple and where every you get you podcasts to give us 5 stars and leave a review!</p>

<p>This episode we cover the amorality of technology and how it butts up against the messy real world of people and trying to model things like language and intent as implementation requirements. Hilarity ensues!</p>



<p>In 2017 the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA">Slaughterbots!</a> was posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube </a>that showed a black Mirror like future where assassin drones existed and got slightly out of hand.  This video was targeted at all the designers and engineers that could actually build something like that and to consider some of the less savory practical applications that their work could lead to.</p>



<p>Last episode coverage of metaverse saw a 25% decline in the parent company <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta/">Meta </a>the very next day, so we are hoping that our coverage here will lead to a similar decline in Slaughterbots, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">correlation is causation</a> right?</p>

NFT, DAO, fungible, what does it all mean and do I need a cream for that? Everything you wanted to know about decentralized autonomous organization and decentralized prediction markets, but were afraid to ask! Will it reinvigorate the art market, or is it the same man wearing a different suit?\r\n\r\nWe break down, break out and break up some of the lingo to see if there is anything to the hype, the answer may surprise you ...

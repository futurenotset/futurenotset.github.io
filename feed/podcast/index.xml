    	<description><![CDATA[Just in time for Christmas (2021 for whoever is keeping track) we finally get to discuss where crypto is going.  NFT, DAO, fungible, what does it all mean and do I need a cream for that? Everything you wanted to know about decentralized autonomous organization and decentralized prediction markets, but were afraid to ask! Will it reinvigorate the art market, or is it the same man wearing a different suit?

We break down, break out and break up some of the lingo to see if there is anything to the hype, the answer may surprise you ... (its yes BTW!).]]></description>

    	<description><![CDATA[This is it! The Crypto episode, it is the one topic that has been asked for again and again, so you get it! We cover how it all began and the two nerds that Dave and Jonathan are early forays into crypto before it was cool! How did we all get from spending 20 BTC on a cup a coffee to the total market cap exceeding $2.5 Trillion (That is Trillion with a T). This podcast seeks to unwrap some of the babbozzling parts of crypto explain what it is all about. Well we give it a red hot go at least!

This topic turned out to be too huge, so join us next episode when the crypto experience really takes off!]]></description>

We are now in the unique position to form an international cartel to control not only production, but distribution of these microchips.</p></blockquote>

    	<description><![CDATA[Well we're back and we have unfinished business. In our last epsidode we started discussing he RSS tags added to help make podcasting more searchable, and like a good cliffhanger we finished before even getting to the value tag. Nothing seems to have energised the podcasting community like the value tag.

The value tag has been, depending on where you stand, proposed or introduced to the RSS standard for podcasting, well what it is and how does it work. Getting paid for podcasting by the people who are listening, is that even possible?

    YES!

It starts off simple enough, but before long we are well deep into the crypto world of bitcoin, lightning, trust and trustless systems, n entry ledgers where n>2, Wild!

For the record this podcast is v4v compliant and has an active ligtning address, feel free to pop us a boost. If you want to do it old schoole here is an address:

    	<description><![CDATA[Lets talk about wearing masks.  Some people have to wear masks as part of their day to day life, now the whole world is in some way used to wearing a mask to get about their day. Dave and Jonathan are happy to wear masks for the risk prevention the afford, maths is on their side, however it doesn't mean that they like them.  Dave has taken up chewing gum to counter act his bad breath!

While also big fans of a good conspiracy, we still struggle to figure out how to send a wireless 5G tracking microchip down a hypodermic needle.  Do you know how hard it is to get a 5G modem to work? I mean seriously! The person/company who achieve that will not do it is secret, they'll take that company public and be the biggest IPO ever seen! Just sayin!]]></description>

<p>This episode Dave and Jon discuss the classic 90s movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(1992_film)">Sneakers</a>. A moderately successful film on release in 1992, it turns out to be one of the most prescient and visionary movies ever made to predicted the world in which we find ourselves living today. Ransonware attacks on public utilities. Questionable motivations of the United States Government Employees against its own citizens and computer dating, its all there!</p>



<p><strong>Dave Note</strong>: To the content holders of the movie sequel rights, let&#8217;s talk, I have loads of ideas!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There&#8217;s a war out there, old friend. A world war. And it&#8217;s not about who&#8217;s got the most bullets. It&#8217;s about who controls the information. What we see and hear, how we work, what we thinkâ¦ it&#8217;s all about the information!</p><cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Cosmo</a></cite></blockquote>
